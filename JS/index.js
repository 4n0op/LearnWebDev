//To define variables in JS you use the word 'let'.
//Shown above the way to define a variable would be to use let then the variable name and then the thing that is being stored inside the variable. 
// There are some words that can't be used as a variable because JS will think you are trying to use something else. For example (if, else, and var) can not be used.
