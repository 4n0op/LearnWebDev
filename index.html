    <!--IMAGE CSS COMMENTS-->
    <!--<style> is used in CSS to make the front end of your website look better-->
    <!--When we used img under style it allows us to edit how our picture looks to the user. So we used width to make the image look smaller.-->
    <!--The border-radius command allows us to add a slight curve on the border of our image. If you set your border radius to half of the width, you can get a circular image. -->
    <!--Float allows you to move the picture to a side of the website that you choose.-->
    <!--Margin adds a space between the picture and the text.-->
    <!--TAGS CSS COMMENTS-->
    <!--Font Weight allows the user to bold their text.-->
    <!--If you use classes it allows you to seperate the style of certain paragraphs on the website instead of everything under paragraph.-->
